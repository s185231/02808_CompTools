      "text/plain": "'No female, whether they are of the blood or through marriage, survives THE SCARLETTI CURSE. They all violently die. One of the villagers Nicoletta knows first hand that her own mother was a victim of the curse. Still, she lives life to the fullest and uses her abilities to heal people. Her guardian helps hide the secret that Nicoletta has empathic talents by fostering the idea she is just the village healer to keep her safe from Giovanni Scarletti.However, the kind Nicoletta helps cure ailing lass, suffering from dining on a contaminated meal with her uncle Giovanni. He immediately realizes that Nicoletta is his life mate and will protect her from his enemies, but will his need to keep her safe end up making him follow the footsteps of his ancestors who loved so deep they killed for love?Though there is a political sidebar that adds suspense to the tale, this gothic story line belongs to the two lead characters. Nicoletta is the classic heroine willing to do the right thing even at the cost of her own life. Giovanni is the dark brooding alpha male wanting to also do the right thing for his people and especially his beloved. Toss on top of the key theme a bit of the paranormal and readers have Christine Feehan\\'s intrepid venture outside the Carpathian realm (see her \"Dark\" series) into a totally different sub-genre that proves she is a versatile talent who deserves a wide readership.Harriet Klausner'"

Voyager finds itself in a system where a planet might have existed, but doesn't. Where the planet should have been, millions and then billions of people are appearing from nowhere and dying in the vacuum of space. To solve the mystery and save billions of lives, Captain Janeway will have to face alternate versions of herself and the crew of Voyager -- not just one almost-mirror-image, but many. Janeway will have to find a way to work with her alternate selves, with whom she shares much but each of whom has a different agenda. At stake is the survival of Voyager and the lives of billions of innocent people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\nThe CEO of the fastest growing Hispanic-owned business in America offers strategies for success in life and in business, covering such topics as discovering your passion, finding a mentor, and persevering despite setbacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\nTells how the French underground and the Allies prevented the fulfillment of Hitler's sentence of destruction for Paris                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\nThe sequel to the masterpiece All Quiet on the Western Front, The Road Back is a classic novel of the slow return of peace to Europe in the years following World War I. After four grueling years, the Great War has finally ended. Now Ernst and the few men left from his company cannot help wondering what will become of them. The town they departed as eager young men seems colder, their homes smaller, the reasons their comrades had to die even more inexplicable. For Ernst and his friends, the road back to peace is more treacherous than they ever imagined. Suffering food shortages, political unrest, and a broken heart, Ernst undergoes a crisis that teaches him what there is to live for—and what he has that no one can ever take away. “The world has a great writer in Erich Maria Remarque. He is a craftsman of unquestionably first rank, a man who can bend language to his will. Whether he writes of men or of inanimate nature, his touch is sensitive, firm, and sure.”—The New York Times Book Review    1\nName: count, Length: 19875, dtype: int64"
