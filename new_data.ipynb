Devastated, she deserts the plush boardrooms of Manhattan for life in the Virginia horse country and a job at a weekly newspaper. Fate leads her to rescue an abandoned, one-eyed horse named Silver Dreams. When she finally rides the gray thoroughbred, she's amazed to discover how fast he can run. But can he race? For the answer she seeks out trainer Whit Riley, a bitter recluse. Soon, Leigh enters the high stakes world of thoroughbred racing and an explosive relationship with Whit while challenged by a scheming young widow determined to take both Whit and Silver Dreams away from her. Silver Dreams, a rags-to-riches horse, proves to be the catalyst needed for Leigh to open her heart and find love and fulfillment. Brilliantly captures the world of thoroughbred horses and the people who love them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\nNobel Prize winner Yasunari Kawabata’s Thousand Cranes is a luminous story of desire, regret, and the almost sensual nostalgia that binds the living to the dead. While attending a traditional tea ceremony in the aftermath of his parents’ deaths, Kikuji encounters his father’s former mistress, Mrs. Ota. At first Kikuji is appalled by her indelicate nature, but it is not long before he succumbs to passion—a passion with tragic and unforeseen consequences, not just for the two lovers, but also for Mrs. Ota’s daughter, to whom Kikuji’s attachments soon extend. Death, jealousy, and attraction convene around the delicate art of the tea ceremony, where every gesture is imbued with profound meaning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1\nA thrilling World War I novel from global bestseller Wilbur Smith 'A master storyteller' - Sunday Times 'Wilbur Smith is one of those benchmarks against whom others are compared' - The Times 'With action on every page, battle, murder and sudden death, Shout at the Devil is not for quiet evening enjoyment by peace-loving readers.

After four grueling years, the Great War has finally ended. Now Ernst and the few men left from his company cannot help wondering what will become of them. The town they departed as eager young men seems colder, their homes smaller, the reasons their comrades had to die even more inexplicable. For Ernst and his friends, the road back to peace is more treacherous than they ever imagined. Suffering food shortages, political unrest, and a broken heart, Ernst undergoes a crisis that teaches him what there is to live for—and what he has that no one can ever take away. “The world has a great writer in Erich Maria Remarque.
